# Differential-Equation-Grapher
helps to visualize differential equations

Javafx based graphing tool, user can type in an equation in terms of x and y (case sensisitive) into the textfield
The program integrates the user input using a Runge-Kuttta 4th order algorithm with predicitive stepsize
all lines are by defualt drawn from (0,y) where y takes about 10 values, if one wants to visualize a function through another point,
they can add a line using the 'add line' button
