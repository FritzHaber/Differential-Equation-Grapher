# Differential-Equation-Grapher
Helps to visualize differential equations

Javafx based graphing tool, user can type in an equation in terms of x and y into the textfield
and the program integrates the user input using a Runge-Kutta 4th order algorithm with predicitive stepsize.
All lines are by default drawn from (0,y) where -6 < y < 6, if the user wants to visualize a function through another point,
they can add a line using the 'add line' button
